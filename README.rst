Flask-FIDO
==========

Flask-FIDO is a Flask extension that supports the `FIDO web
authentication standard <https://fidoalliance.org/>`_ Developers will
be able to support users logging into their apps with a Yubikey or
similar, giving a more secure and more decentralised authentication
mechanism than say Auth2.0.
